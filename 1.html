    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
      for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.<br>
      Web browsers recieve HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
      and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
      a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of
      the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML contructs,
      images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the
      rendered page.
